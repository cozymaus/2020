	<h1>About Liz</h1>

	<p>Hello! My name is <strong>Liz</strong>. I am a bilingual Cuban-American front-end web developer, self-taught digital artist, and writer. I graduated magna cum laude from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ in May 2019 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in information technology and informatics, a certificate of game production and innovation, and a minor in digital communication, information, and media. In July 2019 I joined a company full-time as a Junior Web Producer.</p> 

	<p>Currently I am mostly focusing on my full-time job, but I'm also practicing my skills on my personal websites. My favorite aspects of web development are troubleshooting and redesigns on static, Joomla, or WordPress websites.</p>
	
	<p>I am introverted, punctual, meticulous, and a quick, independent learner. However, I am not afraid to ask questions and love working with friendly people. According to the DiSC personality assessment, I am a Cs type. In my free time I enjoy watching anime and movies, playing games casually, pursuing my artistic interests, and being with my family. I am fluent in Spanish and English and know some French and German, but I also hope to learn some Polish.</p>
